PROJECT SETUP-

I have apply transfer learning in my project by using pre-trained models, such InceptionV3, that have been trained on massively parallel datasets like ImageNet. Among the many advantages of this method are its better generalisation, less computational requirements, and quicker convergence.I have  import necessary libraries like Matplotlib and TensorFlow to set up our project. Next, I specify the directory directories for my dataset and establish characteristics like the batch size, picture size, and number of classes.
